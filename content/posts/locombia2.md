The pack list for this trip should be pretty simple. So I'm sure I've forgotten something.

The climate is tropical and most probably dry this time of the year. Yet I don't know if I will resist the urge to bring a light wool sweater. Having previously lived in Colombia, I know it can be a bit chilly at night.

We are skipping camping, and that makes the packing list considerably shorter.  It have been nice to camp, but with all the climbing we will have to do, it's a relief not having to carry a tent, mattress, sleeping bag and cooking equipment.

The packing list composes the following:

* 4 T-shirts for biking
* 2 T-shirts for dancing
* 2 shorts (one for swimming)
* 2 pairs of short tights
* Sandals
* 5 pairs of socks
* 4 pairs of boxer shorts
* 1 rain jacket
* 1 wool sweater
* 1 pair of sneakers (for dancing)
* 1 pair of jeans (for dancing)
* 1 camera
* 2 spare camera batteries
* 1 pair of sunglasses
* 1 bag with assorted toiletries (including deodorant for dancing)
* 1 USB cable
* 1 beanie
* 1 helmet
* 1 pair of bike shoes
* 2 spare tubes
* 1 flat tire repair kit
* 1 neck gaiter
* 1 tennis ball
* 1 golf ball
* 1 notebook
* 1 pen
* 1 mini tripod
* 1 ND filter
* 1 water bottle
* 1 water bladder
* 1 small dry bag
* 2 pairs of spare brake pads
* 1 powerful headlight (a life lesson has taught me to bring one)
* 1 ebook reader
* Sunblock
* 1 towel

Passport and credit card will be added to the list, along with some spare bike parts. Test packing shows I still have room to spare. So what is missing?

*In case we will get to explore some sports we have never tried on the way. Maybe?*

*Everything must fit in these bags.*
